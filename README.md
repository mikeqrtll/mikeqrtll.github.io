3) Summary of Bootstrap enhancements:

For Assignment 4, I utilized Bootstrap in nearly every section of my website. Starting 
from the top, I used Bootstrap to create an entirely new navbar that collapses when the 
window is made smaller. Additionally the brand/link font size on the left side of the 
navbar is increased with larger screen sizes and decreased with smaller screen sizes, 
generally apparent with mobile devices. The white horizontal line changes sizes with 
different size devices (200 px with devices smaller than min-width 460px, 450px with 
anything larger). For the Education portion, I created some images and captions
and using Bootstrap, they will be displayed side by side or stacked on top of each other
depending on the size of the device. This change greatly improved the look on all
devices. Similar to the education section, my experience section displays both of my 
Co-op experiences side by side or stacked on top of each other depending on the width 
of the window or screen. These were both accomplished using the Bootstrap format we've 
discussed in class. The Contact Information section utilizes media queries to determine
an appropriate size for the text to ensure that both the email and link stay on the same
line but do not exceed the borders of the window. The Assignments section utilizes Bootstrap
to ensure that the images and links are uniformly distributed on all media devices. On a large
device they will be displayed 4 links wide, side by side. On a medium device they will display
in a 2 X 2 grid, with two on top and two on bottom. On smaller devices they will stack on top
of each other, one on top of another. Prior to these additions, the website didnt adapt well
to the device it was being accessed on. Now there are noticable differences when accessing the
webpage on larger and smaller devices. The changes create a better user experience.
