Implemented Features and Status:
I was able to sucessfully implement the base requirement of this assignment. 
This includes drag and drop of tiles, correctly ensure user drops tiles in 
acceptable locations on the board, submitting a word for a score, tallying 
scores of multiple rounds, bonus tiles, restarting the game, returning placed 
tiles to the rack and swapping out current tiles for new ones. All these 
operation keep track of the game score and the number-remaing of each type 
of tile. My implementation check entries against a dictionary and is a single 
line implementation (does not implement full board).
